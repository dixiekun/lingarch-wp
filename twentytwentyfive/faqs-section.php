            <p>We guarantee accuracy with our two-stage review process. Every document is translated by a certified industry specialist, then reviewed by a second expert translator. If an error occurs, we provide immediate corrections at no cost and take full responsibility for any direct consequences. For high-stakes legal or regulatory documents, we also carry professional liability insurance for additional protection.</p>

            <p>We offer guaranteed rush services for critical deadlines. Most urgent legal documents can be completed within 24-48 hours, and regulatory submissions typically within 3-5 days, depending on complexity. We charge transparent rush fees (25-50% premium) and provide binding delivery commitments with financial penalties if we miss your deadline.</p>

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Our legal translators are practicing attorneys or paralegals with translation certification. Our pharmaceutical translators have regulatory affairs or clinical research backgrounds. Our financial translators are CPAs or have investment banking experience. We don't assign generic linguists to specialized content that could impact your business.</p>

            <p>Yes. We maintain current knowledge of FDA, EMA, SEC, and other regulatory standards that affect document formatting, certification requirements, and submission protocols. Our translators understand jurisdiction-specific legal precedents, accounting standards differences (GAAP vs IFRS), and compliance documentation requirements.</p>

            <p>Every translator signs binding NDAs before accessing your documents. We use encrypted file transfer systems and secure project management platforms. Our processes meet attorney-client privilege standards for legal work and HIPAA requirements for medical content. We can also work under your existing confidentiality frameworks if preferred.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>AI fails catastrophically on specialized content where context and precision matter. A mistranslated contract clause can void agreements. Incorrect medical dosages can harm patients. Financial statement errors can trigger regulatory sanctions. Our expert translators understand the business and legal implications of every word choice, not just language conversion.</p>
