				<p>Designing your dream kitchen with Aantarika is a collaborative, step-by-step journey:</p>
				<div class="design-timinng">
					<div class="customisation">
						<h3>1. Understanding Your Vision</h3>
						<p>We begin by engaging with you in detailed conversations to understand your culinary habits,
							aesthetic preferences, and overall vision for your kitchen.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="customisation">
						<h3>2. Crafting a Mood Board & 3D Visualisation</h3>
						<p>Next, we develop a mood board that captures the essence of your style, followed by a
							realistic 3D rendering. This allows you to visualize the final outcome before we move
							forward, ensuring every element aligns with your personal taste.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="customisation">
						<h3>3. Detailed 2D Drawings & Custom Craftsmanship
						</h3>
						<p>Once the 3D concept is approved, we translate it into precise 2D drawings. With our own
							factory at hand, we custom-craft each cabinet, countertop, and fixture, ensuring quality,
							durability, and a perfect fit for your space.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="customisation">
						<h3>4. Seamless On-Site Installation & Finishing Touches
						</h3>
						<p>After all elements are crafted, our team carefully installs each component, ensuring a
							flawless fit and finish. Beyond that, we guide you through the final stages of soft
							furnishing, selecting appropriate decor and ensuring every accessory complements your
							kitchen’s style, so that every detail reflects your vision and enhances the overall
							ambience.
