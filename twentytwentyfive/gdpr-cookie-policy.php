                <h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>

                <h2>Your personal information</h2>
                <p>This privacy policy explains how we collect and process your personal data. Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. This includes information that you tell us, what we learn from you and the choices you make about the marketing you want us to send to you.

                <h2>Changes to data protection law</h2>

                <p>This privacy policy tells you about most of your rights under the new law, but we may need to update it again before the 25 May 2018.</p>
                <p>There may also be further changes which we will be required to make to this privacy policy after the 25 May – we will notify you every time we make a change to this policy. We may need to ask you to agree to the changes or refresh your consent to us using your personal information.</p>
